                      <h3>The Color Scheme</h3>
                      <p>When I think of the Bay area and Prisons, I think of the Golden Gate bridge, dark and scary prisons, and the beach. I think I will stick with fall colors, oranges, yellows, and reds.
                      </p>
                      
                      <h4>The Font</h4>
                      <p>For the font for my web site, I want to use something that is easy to read and clarify lettering.<br>
                     Depending on the background color, I will use whatever color makes the text easier to read. I decided to go with the Pathway Gothic One font. My web site is currently using it.</p>
                 
                      
                      <h4>The Logo</h4>
                      <p>Using a free logo creator, I created a simple logo. The three leaves represent the three events in the race, running, swimming, and biking<br>
                      <img src='/triathlon/images/ptplogo.png' alt='The Logo'>
                      </p>
                      
                      <h3>Typography</h3>
                      <p>Like I mentioned before, I will be using the Pathway Gothic One font. I will use the default size for the body content, but for navigation I will bigger font and different colors to make it easier to find and read.</p>
                      
                      <h3>Navigation</h3>
                      <p>For my navigation, I will use internal links placed at the top of the page. I want to use a minimal design in the web site, therefore the navigation will stick out and be a part of the design. They will be large and easy to find. I want them to appear one color but once you hover over them, I want them to change color.</p>
                      
                      <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
                      <p>In today's world, so many people have tablets and smart phone devices. The desktop computer is turning into something that no one has anymore. Since this is the popular trend, I am wanting the webpage to be able to adapt to any device it is looked up on. Whether that is a smartphone or a tablet. In a perfect world I would create a mobile site but right now that is a little out of my skill level.</p>

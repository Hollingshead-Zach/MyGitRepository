                      <h2><i>Time Spent</i></h2>
                      <p>This week I decided to spend sometime trying to get my home page video to work on all web browsers. I noticed that I couldn't get it to work on Firefox specifically.<br>
                      So I spent 1-2 hours studying and figuring out how to convert my mv4 video to webm.</p>

                  <li>
                      <h2><i>Topics studied</i></h2>
                      <p>Like I mentioned before, I studied how to convert my original video, which was an mv4 format, to other formats. After searching the internet for some times, I found a program<br>
                      that did format conversion. The program is called handbrake, it was a free download and is very easy to use. I uploaded my mv4 video and converted it to mp4. I changed my code, and now my video plays on Firefox.</p>

                  <li>
                      <h2><i>Example</i></h2>
                      <p>Here is HandBrake, the video format conversion program I used on my homepage video.</p>

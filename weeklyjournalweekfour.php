                      <p>After last weeks practice with making a video, I decided to put up my video on my home page. I spent 1-2 hours reading about the code and getting my video to work.</p>

                  <li>
                      <h2><i>Topics studied</i></h2>
                      <p>I also studied how to do an in-line video. I used Casey Neilson's presentation that he posted on his web site for reference. With his help I was able to upload my video. </p>

                      <p>Here is my home page with my video added. It also loops since it is so short.</p>

                      <p>This week I spent hours gathering content for my website. I spent at least 3-5 hours gathering pictures<br>
                      and info about my sisters company, the Halfpenny Post.</p>

                      <h2><i>Topics studied</i></h2>
                      <p>One thing I studied was actually a challenge for me. I am wanting to create a slide show with various pictures<br>
                              and since I don't have any experience doing this, I am going to try and figure it out.</p>

                      <h2><i>Example</i></h2>
                      <p>Here is my organization of my pictures I gathered this week. I made sure to organize them within a folder.<br>
                          so when I do reference them, it will make things a lot easier.</p>

                      <h3>The Color Scheme</h3>
                      <p>Sticking to the logos colors I will use variations of grey, black, white and red.
                      Specifically I will use these colors:<br>
                      <img src='/images/black.png' alt='The black color'>
                      <img src='/images/red.png' alt='The red color'>
                      <img src='/images/white.png' alt='The white color'>
                      <img src='/images/grey.png' alt='The grey color'>
                      </p>
                      
                      <h4>The Font</h4>
                      <p>For the font for my web site, I want to use something that is easy to read and clarify lettering.<br>
                     Depending on the background color, I will use whatever color makes the text easier to read. I decided to go with the Josefin Slab font family. My web site is currently using it.</p>
                 
                      
                      <h4>The Logo</h4>
                      <p>Since the Halfpenny Post is an already established company, I will use the logo associated with the company<br>
                      <img src='/images/siteplanlogo.jpg' alt='The Logo'>
                      </p>
                      
                      <h3>Typography</h3>
                      <p>Like I mentioned before, I will be using the Josefin Slab font family. I will use the default size for the body content, but for navigation I will bigger font and different colors to make it easier to find and read.</p>
                      
                      <h3>Navigation</h3>
                      <p>For my navigation, I will use internal links placed at the top of the page. I want to use a minimal design in the web site, therefore the navigation will stick out and be a part of the design. They will be large and easy to find. I want them to appear one color but once you hover over them, I want them to change color.</p>
                      
                      <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
                      <p>In today's world, so many people have tablets and smart phone devices. The desktop computer is turning into something that no one has anymore. Since this is the popular trend, I am wanting the webpage to be able to adapt to any device it is looked up on. Whether that is a smartphone or a tablet. In a perfect world I would create a mobile site but right now that is a little out of my skill level.</p>
                      
                      
                          <h4>Desktop</h4>
                          <p>Here is what I imagine my home page to look like on a desktop</p>

                          <p>Here is what I imagine my Current Projects page to look like on a desktop</p>

                          <h4>Mobile Device</h4>
                          <p>Here is what I imagine my mobile version of the site to be like. I would love to learn and teach myself how to do mobile sites.</p>

                          <p>I imagine my web site to look similar to a desktop format on a tablet. Here is what I envision.</p>

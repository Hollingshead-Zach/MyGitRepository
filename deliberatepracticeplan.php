                      <p>
                        I will practice on my own time at home as well with other peers<br>
                        on campus. We will meet in the library a few times a week and maybe<br>
                        a few times outside of the library.
                          </p>

                  <li>
                      <h2><i>When?</i></h2>
                      <p>
                        I will practice whenever I get the chance. Whether that is in class<br>
                        or at home. I have a few classes where we are working with html, giving<br>
                        me plenty of practice with html. I will also spend extra time messing around<br>
                        seeing what works and what doesn't.
                          </p>

                      <h2><i>How?</i></h2>
                      <p>
                       I will uses plenty of programs to help me achieve my practice plan.<br>
                       I will use Netbeans, the documents provided, the websites provided and other<br>
                       documents provided to help me learn and teach. Teaching and helping others will <br>
                       also help me learn. I will also spend at least 4-6 hours a week doing this.
                          </p>
                  </li>

                      <p>
                        I will work with my friend Casey Neilson whenever we need help or have questions.

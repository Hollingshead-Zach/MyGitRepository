                      <p>This week I spent 2-3 hours making sure I had at least 14 pages for my entire project. I did this by making every picture in my past projects page, its own page.</p>

                      <p>This week I studied some javascript code that helped me achieve a "Click to Enlarge" effect on my pictures.</p>
                  </li>

                      <h2><i>Example</i></h2>
                      <p>Here is a picture of my code, you can see the php code in it that links to the head and header php files. It helps organize your pages and makes it easy to make any changes.</p>

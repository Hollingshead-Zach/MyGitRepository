                      <p>This week I spent time tackling my slide show idea I want for the home page of my web site. After viewing Casey's presentation<br>
                      I decided to make a slide show in iMovie and then export it as a video. This way I can just have a video instead of writing out all the <br>
                      code for a slide show.</p>
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>
                      <h2><i>Topics studied</i></h2>
                      <p>I studied more on how to link a video and how to get it to loop. It isn't very long but if I can loop it, it will appear to be longer.</p>
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>
                      <h2><i>Example</i></h2>
                      <p>I took my pictures from my images folder and imported them into iMovie and created a slide show, here is a screen shot of it.</p>
